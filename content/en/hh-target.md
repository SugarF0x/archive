This plugin removes targets from HeadHunter job listing anchors.
<!--more-->
I got pretty sick of browsing jobs on HeadHunter and always ending up with a billion tabs open
since every job item click results in a new tab being opened. Given that this behavior is not
optional, I had to resort to making a dedicated plugin specifically for that so as to save my sanity.

You can get it on Chrome Web Store or install manually from GitHub.
