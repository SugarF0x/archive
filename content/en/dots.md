A database of all the remarkable players, both good and bad, we met on our journey to Master Ranks.
<!--more-->
On this interactive database one can look up player names and see if they have any recorded entries, containing
hero dedicated ranks and comments on their plays.

New entries can be added only by authenticated users, namely - those, having access to the password protected
auth page. Once logged in, the user will be able to create new entries on queried users.

Both database interactions and authentication process are hosted on a `Node` + `Express` server.
