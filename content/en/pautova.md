Freelance project for displaying masterclass mentors and managing feedback requests.
<!--more-->
I was contacted by a client to make a website where user could sign up for master classes.
The system implied ability to browse through available teachers, check their dedicated profile page out,
and submit a contact info form to the server for processing and further callback from the management team.

This all meant the following:

* Home page with dynamically displayed teachers along with links to their profiles
* Teachers' dedicated profile pages
  * Dynamic profile route
  * Submit form
* Back-end server for handling requests as well as displaying them and managing their states by the administration
  * Auth system for said data access

This project was orally agreed upon along with its requirements and payment terms.
I didn't waste a minute and created demonstration project to show to the client what it would eventually look like
mechanically speaking (design was to be provided by their own designer later).
Since then the client has gone rouge.

If the client does come back, I might get back to it. Until then, there is no point hosting this project,
since it's actually a worse version of what you can already see on this very Archive page - they use
the same technology stack, however Archives page is much more elaborate.
