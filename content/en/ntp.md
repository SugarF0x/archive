A complete rewrite of an existing site with minimalistic style changes under client's supervision.
<!--more-->
The task was to move an existing web page from **Jimdo** CMS along with making a few style changes, mainly
focusing on simplifying the UI and making it as much _"black and white"_ as possible. The original layout
_"resembled an obituary"_.

The new web-app includes:

* Seamless routing
* Complete bi-lingual support: Russian and English
* Responsive layout

The majority of the content is provided via `Nuxt Content`, the rest is stored in locale files and is mostly a part
of UI elements.
