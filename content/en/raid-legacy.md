A passion-replica of Dungeon Raid - an old and no longer updated smartphone game.
<!--more-->
Given that Dungeon Raid stopped updating back in like 2013 or something like that,
resulting in abysmally poor performance even on latest top-end devices,
I took it upon myself to replicate the glorious game Dungeon Raid once was.

Since the only thing I know of how to do was web dev, I decided to start working on it via canvas, thus
effectively also working on this project being responsive enough to work on all devices.

The project consist of one single component - the game itself. Yet it is wrapped in **Nuxt**. That is to easily convert it
into a **Progressive Web App** for users to install it on their smartphones and use it offline.

The code for all the logic is written in **TypeScript** with most of all the type checks maintained to the fullest.

Given my lack of experience, the development is not going exactly smoothly. I am open for criticism. Any contributions
to the repository are more than welcome.
