Snake game written on pure JS using table element as display.
<!--more-->
This game was developed as a part of my learning course at **GeekBrains**. The rendering is based on a HTML table
with its cells being colored according to the game state.

The game is really simple and is very poorly made given it being one of my very first entries in the world of JS.
This source code spaghetti still torments me in my nightmares.

Nevertheless, feel free to explore it on its active link provided. However, I suggest you stay away from the git repo.
Wash your eyes with bleach at least if you actually feel like delving into this abyss.
